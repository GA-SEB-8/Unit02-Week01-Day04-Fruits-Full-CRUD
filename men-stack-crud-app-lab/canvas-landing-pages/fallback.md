## About

In this lab, your challenge is to create a complete full-stack application using Node.js, Express, EJS, and MongoDB. Your application will center around a resource or schema of your choosing, for which you will implement full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities. This is an opportunity to apply your understanding of Mongoose, Express, and EJS to a real-world-like scenario.
