**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to add new documents to a MongoDB database using the `create()` method in Mongoose.

## The `create()` method

Mongoose models provide various methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. These methods are **asynchronous**, and facilitate the creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion of documents in the database. 
 
A model's [`create()`](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/model.html#Model.create()) method is used for adding new documents to the database. It's an asynchronous function that takes an object as an argument and returns the newly created document upon successful execution.

> ðŸš¨ For the `create()` method to execute successfully, the input object must adhere to the structure defined by the model's schema. If the object does not match the schema, Mongoose will respond with an error.

Let's take a look at the anatomy of the `create()` method:

1. **Document Returned**: The newly created document based on the schema.
2. **Model**: The Mongoose model (`Todo`) used for the operation.
3. **Model Method**: The `create()` method of the model.
4. **Object Argument**: The data used to create the new document.

## Creating a new todo

For this demonstration, we'll work within `queries.js`. Our setup here differs from a typical Node/Express application to focus on gaining familiarity with Mongoose.

### Import the model

Import the `Todo` model at the top of `queries.js`:

```javascript
// queries.js
const Todo = require('./models/todo.js');
```

### Build the `createTodo` function

Let's build out a function to handle the creation of our new `todo`:

```javascript
// queries.js

const createTodo = async () => {

  const todoData = {
    text: "Learn JS",
    isComplete: false,
  };
  
  const todo = await Todo.create(todoData);
  console.log("New todo:", todo);
};
```

> Note: Data will typically arrive on the server via the `request` object, but for this example, we've hard-coded some todo data in the function

In the `createTodo` function, we first define an object called `todoData`. It contains the details for our new todo. We then use the `Todo` model's `create()` method to add this data as a document in the database. If the operation succeeds, the function outputs the newly created `todo` to the console.

Next, we'll call `createTodo` within the `runQueries` function:

```javascript
// queries.js
const runQueries = async () => {
  console.log('Queries running.');
  await createTodo();
};
```

## Running the `createTodo` function

To execute the `createTodo` function, run the `queries.js` file with the following command:

```bash
node queries.js
```

Check your terminal for the following output:

```plaintext
New todo: {
  text: 'Learn JS',
  isComplete: false,
  _id: new ObjectId('65777e33f4a45a8462ae3054'),
  __v: 0
}
```

This output shows the newly created `todo` document. It includes the properties we specified, along with an automatically generated `_id` (a unique identifier assigned by MongoDB) and `__v` (a version key used to track how many updates have been made to the document).

> ðŸ’¡ In Mongoose, every document automatically gets an `_id` property, even if it's not explicitly defined in the schema. This `_id` is a unique identifier generated by Mongoose using MongoDB's `ObjectId` type. It ensures that each document in the database has at least one unique property that we can use to easily find/update/delete it, without affecting other documents.


## ðŸŽ“ You Do

To add more todos, modify the `todoData` in `createTodo` and execute the `queries.js` file again.
